# SS13 Prison Project (Phoenix Station Penitentiary)

## Below will be a summary and explanation of this project. It may be a long read.

# Introduction

The Phoenix Station project, or Prison Project if you will, was born from the combined idea of several television shows revolving around prisons (think OITNB and others), as well as the request for it existing on the SS13 Reddit.

The project has as aim to offer a different and new environment than we're currently come to appreciate in Space Station 13.

It is intended to be a full conversion, offering its own items, jobs, sprites, and much more in the course of due time.

While I'm the sole official developer on this project as of 18 February, the github might have long periods of silence before receiving a rather large update again. This isn't a project that's expected to be done in a matter of months.

# Intricate workings

Not much is known yet for the intricate workings. A lot of systems have yet to pan out fully according to station layout and how we want to tackle this.

So far, the following jobs are known;
1. Warden
2. Captain of the Guards
3. Counselor
4. Correctional Officer (/ Junior Correctional Officer)
5. Station Engineer and Atmospherics Technician.
6. Doctor and nurse.
7. Chief Supply Officer (ambig. Quartermaster)
8. Inmate.

And many more jobs are yet to come.

# Station

The station is intended to be of older build already by the time the actual game plays, which compliments its somewhat clunky design and sometimes useless interconnecting hallways.

There will be plenty of insecurities taken into account for the inmates to take advantage of and plenty of area's where things or people can go missing. The same goes for camera coverage. There will be no Artificial Intelligence, but rather a dispatch office that overlooks the camera's. The camera's can't see everywhere thought.
